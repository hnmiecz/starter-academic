I am a PhD Candidate in Communication at Stanford University studying media psychology. My research interests include dyadic and group dynamics, social cognition, linguistic and conversational analyses in the area of human-machine communication, with a focus on AI. I am also interested in the conceptualization and measurement of digital media use.

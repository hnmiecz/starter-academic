I am a 5th year PhD Candidate in Communication at Stanford University studying media psychology. My research examines how people perceive AI systems in interpersonal communication, and how these perceptions influence our language and the ways we think about ourselves and others. I am also interested in the conceptualization and measurement of digital media use.

Feel free to contact me via email (hnmiecz@stanford.edu) or Twitter (@hnmiecz).

AI-MC is communication between people in which a computational agent operates on behalf of a communicator by modifying, augmenting, or generating messages to accomplish communication or interpersonal goals. This burgeoning research area prompts re-evaluation and potentially expansion of theories in computer-mediated communication. I am particularly interested in how text-based AI might influence language production and interpersonal dynamics in conversation. Furthermore, I am asking ethical questions about the role of AI in reinforcing and/or dismantling human stereotypes and biases.

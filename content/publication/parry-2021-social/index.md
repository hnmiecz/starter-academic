title: 'Social Media and Well-being: A Methodological Perspective'
subtitle: ''
summary: 'We provide a review of five methodological developments poised to provide increased understanding in the domain of social media and well-being: (1) the use of longitudinal and experimental designs; (2) the adoption of behavioural (rather than self-report) measures of SMU; (3) a shift away from aggregate use; (4) the emergence of an idiographic media effects paradigm; and (5) the use of formal modelling and machine learning.

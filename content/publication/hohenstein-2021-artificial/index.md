title: 'Artificial intelligence in communication impacts language and social relationships'
subtitle: ''
summary: 'Two randomized experiments (n = 1036) provide evidence that a commercially deployed AI changes how people interact with and perceive one another in pro-social and anti-social ways. We find that even though AI can increase communication efficiency and improve interpersonal perceptions, it risks changing usersâ€™ language production and continues to be viewed negatively.
